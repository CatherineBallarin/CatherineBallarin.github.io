subtitle: Handling logistics and creating balance so awesome people can focus on being brilliant at what they do best
---

Hi there! I’m Catherine, a team manager with a knack for turning chaos into clarity.  I believe that true brilliance shines brightest when experts can focus solely on what they do best - and that’s where I come in.

My role is to handle the "everything else", ensuring the path is clear for success. With a blend of organization, logistics, event management, tech know-how, a genuine passion for communication and a generous touch of creativity, I create structure and calm out of complexity. Whether it’s untangling tricky schedules, securing that all-important coffee, negotiating with vendors, or juggling priorities while making sure every detail is covered, I thrive on building environments where people can excel and achieve their best work.

# My Journey
My journey started on the receiving end of great leadership as a team member, where I learned the power of thoughtful guidance and support. Those experiences inspired me to step into leadership roles, managing everything from intricate projects to morale-boosting moments (yes, even fetching life-saving coffees). As I grew, I realized my unique strength: the ability to create structure and clarity, empowering others to focus on what they do best while I handle the “everything else.”

I started out as a teacher, and over six years side-by-side with students of all ages and backgrounds I witnessed firsthand how environments that inspire growth and success aren’t a given - they’re **intentionally created**. During and after COVID, I embraced the unique opportunity to build a business focused on creating these environments across different industries. From warehouses to customer support, to personal assistant roles, and even through professional courses, I learned how to navigate challenges, manage logistics under pressure, and collaborate effectively in fast-paced settings. Through it all, one thing became clear: **my passion lies in supporting extraordinary teams and crafting the conditions they need to thrive.**

# Esports and What Drives Me
One day, a personal love for gaming intersected with my professional skills. What started as a hobby evolved into managing an amateur esports team, where I discovered the joy of blending my passion with my knack for organization.

Esports has been a meaningful chapter in my journey. What captivates me most isn't just the gameplay (go Ninjas! - iykyk). It's the intricate systems behind the scenes: the teamwork, discipline, and culture that make extraordinary performances possible.

Ultimately, my true calling isn't tied to one industry or role. Whether it’s research, tech, esports, or any other field, **there's always a way to create a space where excellence is inevitable**. My mission is to make complex systems work seamlessly and empower others to shine.
