Hi there! I’m Catherine Ballarin, a team manager with a knack for making the impossible look easy. I believe there are some things only the experts can do - and that’s where I come in. I’m here to support those experts by taking care of everything else, so they can stay laser-focused on their brilliance.

Through a magical mix of organization, logistics, event management, and just the right amount of doodling, I turn chaos into clarity. Whether it’s untangling complicated schedules, fetching life-saving coffees, sweet-talking vendors, balancing priorities, and making sure everyone has exactly what they need - I create environments where people can thrive and do their best work.

I’m an expert at ensuring my team has exactly what they need to shine. Creative problem-solving? That’s my bread and butter. Advocacy for my people? Absolutely. Turning hard work into seamless success? Always.
